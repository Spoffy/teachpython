Here are a some further, more advanced tasks you might want to try!
Warning: We may not have covered all of the material for these!

Task 01
##########   

 Write a program that will print out the contents of a multiplication table from 1x1 to 12x12.
  ie. The multiplication table from 1x1 to 3x3 is as follows:
 	1	2	3
 	2	4	6
 	3	6	9

 Hint: You'll probably want to use two for loops for each number.

 Reminder: To print something without putting a newline on the end, you can use print(..., end="\t").
 			You might also want to use tabs so double/triple digit numbers are formatted in a nice table.

 Bonus: See if you can figure out how to print the column headers.

Task 02
##########   

Use a for loop and the knowledge you know about modulo to create a FizzBuzz program.
In the program, the following happens:
	Counting up from 1 to 100:
		If the number is divisible by 3, print Fizz.
		If the number is divisible by 5, print Buzz.
		If the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz.
		Otherwise, just print the number.

Reminder: You can look back at the previous tasks to see how to print, use a for loop and the modulo operator.
